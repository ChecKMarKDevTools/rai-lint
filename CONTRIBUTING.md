## AI Attribution Policy

All commits to this repository must include an AI attribution footer using standard Git trailer format:

1. **`Authored-by: [Human] <email>`** - Human only, no AI involvement
2. **`Commit-generated-by: [AI Tool] <email>`** - Trivial AI (docs, commit msg, reviews, advice, etc)
3. **`Assisted-by: [AI Tool] <email>`** - AI helped, but primarily human code
4. **`Co-authored-by: [AI Tool] <email>`** - Roughly half is AI generated and half human-authored content
5. **`Generated-by: [AI Tool] <email>`** - Majority of code was AI generated

Examples:

```plaintext
Authored-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
Commit-generated-by: ChatGPT <chatgpt@openai.com>
Assisted-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>
Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>
Generated-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>
```

## Development Setup

### Project Development

Projects are defined individually per solution, but are managed by workspaces and a single makefile.

```bash
make install
make format
make lint
make test
make build

# For AI validation, instruct the agent to confirm results with
maake ai-checks
```

## Running Tests

### Node.js Tests

```bash
cd packages/node-commitlint
npm test
npm run test:watch
```

### Python Tests

```bash
cd packages/python-gitlint
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov=gitlint_rai
